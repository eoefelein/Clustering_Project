Background on the dataset implemented in the GMM_Agglomerative_DBSCAN_HDBSCAN.ipynb notebook

NOTES
Take a closer look at S_Dbw metric. That metric doesn't seem to be adding much. Maybe change it out for SD_Validity metric? Maybe add the MeanShift, Spectral or Affinity Propagation algorithm to the notebook?
